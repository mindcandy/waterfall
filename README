# Waterfall

[Waterfall](http://confluence.tool.mindcandy.com/display/PLAT/Waterfall) is a SBT project with a simple UI.
Waterfall is a batch progressing and ETL system. Handles scheduling, dependency and provides a rich library of sources and sinks.

To run the UI __for now__:

Open com.mindcandy.waterfall.Run and set shouldRun to _true_ then run:

```
it:testOnly *RunSpec*
```
